# Python Challenge

## Third Data Analytics and Visualization boot camp homework

It consist of two parts. The first part is creating a Python script that analyses the financial records of a financial institution and generates a report of the findings. The second part is creating a script that counts votes and creates a summary of the results of the election.

### PyBank

This script reads through a csv file [budget_data.csv] and calculates the total number of months in the data sample, the net amount of profit and losses, the month with the greatest profits and the month with the greatest losses. Then it creates a textfile [Financial_Analysis.txt] where it summarizes all the calculated information. It prints it on the console as well.

To run go to the folder PyBank and then run using:
```
python main.py
```

### PyPoll

This script reads a csv file [election_data.txt] and calculates the total number of votes, the votes each candidate received and the percent of votes, and the winner of the election based on the number of votes. Then it creates a file called [Election_Analysis.txt] where it adds all the information generated. It also prints the same information on the console.

To run go to the folder PyPoll and then run using:
```
python main.py
```
